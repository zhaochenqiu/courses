\section*{Potential Research Topics}
%Moving Objects Segmentation in Freely Moving Camera.
The topics of this proposal include but are not limited to:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Background Subtraction in Complex Environment under Stationary Camera.
    \item Background Subtraction under Freely Moving camera.
    \item Motion Segmentation in Complexly Natural Scenes.
    \item Camera Motion Estimation in Complex Scenes.
\end{itemize}

\section*{Topic Introduction:}
Motion is a powerful cue for image and scene segmentation in human visual system \cite{1998_Torr}.
%
The motion cue has wide range of applications such as such as video monitoring, optical motion capturing and multimedia applications.
%
The human ability to detect, segment, analyze and understand motion is nearly instantaneous,
and work well in diversely complex scenes,
such as the presence of multiple objects,
complex background geometry,
observer motion and even camouflage.
%
While there has been much recent progress related to motion,
it still appears we are far from human capabilities.
%
This study is focus on how to detect, segment the motion or the moving objects in the videos captured from natural scenes.
%
The final target of this study is trying to achieve the level of human capabilities for detecting, segmenting or even understanding the motion.

\section*{Project Significance and Background}
% With the continuous growth of videos obtained from natural scenes in recent years,
Today, plenty of work focus on understanding the content of videos \cite{2017_VIDEO}.
%
In particular,
Motion is a fundamental cue for human to segment, analysis and understand objects in videos \cite{2016_ECCV}.
%
Usually,
the first step of applications related to motion is motion detection, moving objects segmentation or background subtraction.
%
Currently, previous work already achieve well performances in the scenes with ow complexity \cite{2017_TPAMI_GANGWANG}.
%
However,
due to the complexity and the diversity of natural scenes,
an accurate background subtraction solution is so hard to proposed in the complexly natural environments, 
even with the assumption of stationary camera \cite{2017_MOTION_REVIEW}.
%
In addition,
With the continuous growth of videos obtained through moving camera in recent years,
more and more applications require the background subtraction algorithms are effect in the freely moving camera \cite{2017_WU}.
%
The problem becomes further challenging once without the assumption of stationary camera.
%
For example, as shown in the \reffig{fig_intro}.
The environments around the horse in different images are completely different due to the camera motion,
and it is very challenging to segment the moving horse accurately.
\begin{figure}[htbp]

    \includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{figure/exp1.pdf}
    \caption{Segmenting moving objects in freely moving camera.}
    \label{fig_intro}
\end{figure}
The image sequences shown in \reffig{fig_intro} are captured from the FBMS dataset \cite{2014_TPAMI_FBMS},
which is the largest dataset to the best of our knowledge.
%
Until today, there is still lack of approach which achieves over 80\% accuracy in the FBMS dataset.
%
Therefore,
more efforts are need in the motion detection, segmentation in complexly natural scenes obtained through freely moving camera.

\section*{The Expected Outcome in the Future 3$\sim$4 Years}
This research can be divided into three part.
\begin{itemize}
    \item Moving objects segmentation in stationary camera.
    \item Accurate camera motion estimation.
    \item Moving objects Segmentation in freely moving camera.
\end{itemize}

In the first year,
we may focus on how to detect moving objects in the stationary camera,
which is a traditional problem of computer vision.
%
Even with 20 decades development,
it remains a challenging problem in the complex natural scenes,
and the publications will main related to the background subtraction in complexly natural scenes.
%
In the next years,
we will focus on the estimation of camera motion.
%
Since the camera motion is the main challenge to segmenting objects in freely camera,
it is important to handle the motion of camera.
%
Although,
several exist work are proposed to estimate the camera motion,
the accuracy is not enough to produce accurate segmentation results.
%
In the step,
the work may related to multi-view geometry, spatio-temporal features or motion segmentation.
%
Finally,
in the rest of time,
we will focus on how to eliminate the boundary between the background subtraction in stationary camera and freely moving camera.
%
We may focus on extending the previous algorithms, or proposing new algorithm to segment moving objects accurately in freely camera.

\section*{How the Project Aligned with the Projects in Computer Vision in ANU}
There are two main challenges to segment the motion in complexly natural scenes obtained through freely moving camera.
%
The first one is the complexity and the diversity of natural scenes,
which already attracts attentions of researcher \cite{2017_MOTION_REVIEW}.
%
The second challenges come from the camera motion,
which is closely related to the projects of computer vision group in ANU.
%
In order to handle the camera motion,
the estimation of camera motion is a direct solution,
and it is closely related to Shaodi et al's work\ \cite{2013_MVA_Motion} and Hongdong et al's work\ \cite{2010_TPAMI_CAMMOTION,2017_motion_hongdong}.
%
In particular,
the descriptor based estimation is related to Barnes et al's work\ \cite{2018_TIP_3DShape},
and the geometry related algorithm belong to Hongdong et al's work\ \cite{2010_TPAMI_REG}.
%
Beside the estimation of camera motion,
the spatio-temporal features is another possible solution,
and optical flow shows advantages in motion segmentation,
which is exactly hongdong et al's work\ \cite{2016_motionseg_ECCV,2014_motion_ICIP}.
%
In addition,
there is maybe a refine procedure to improve the accuracy of results,
and the image segmentation is usually be used in this part,
which is related to hongdong et al's work \cite{2010_SEG}.
%
In a word,
this project is closely related to the projects of computer vision in ANU.
